    `Expectations oppress reality. You start living in an imagined world as opposed to the real one.`,
    `Negative expectations cause hardship in the present. It’s done to prevent potential hardship in the future if the negative event comes to fruition. Practicing negativity harms you in the present and potentially harms your future.`,
    `Positive expectations cause hardship in the future if they don’t come to fruition. In holding positive expectations, you risk harming yourself in the future.`,
    `Positive expectations are better than negative because in the present you are holding a positive futuristic view. But both can hurt you in the future.`,
    `It is best however, to have no expectations at all. No expectations allow you to live in the present moment and be fully immersed in your experiences. With no fear or looking forward to the future.`,
    `Focus on what you can do presently. Realise that you don’t have complete control of the future.`,
