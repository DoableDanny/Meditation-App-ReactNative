    `It is easier to act and cooperate effectively when you understand the human mind, which is to understand your own mind. Understanding how to deal with your inner fears and prejudices.`,
    `The point of meditation is not to escape from reality. It is to get in touch with reality. To observe reality as it is. To explore the mind, not merely focus it.`,
    `The mind can be focused by watching a good thriller movie. But you will not be observing your minds dynamics.`,
    `Watch how your mind wanders. From one thought to the next, the feelings that arise. Make no effort to do or stop anything. Meditation should be completely effortless. Let it flow.`,
