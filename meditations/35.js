    `You may not be aware just how much your surroundings dictate how you feel.`,
    `You can test this out for yourself. Try listening to a sad song whilst paying close attention to how you feel. Then listen to a more upbeat, happy tune and again watch closely.`,
    `External events and you surrounding can have tiny to huge effects on the way you feel.`,
    `The problems arise when thought steps in. An external event may cause feelings of sadness or anxiety. Thought then steps in and you identify with this feeling. “I am sick of feeling like this, what is wrong with me? I’m gonna have to something about this.”.`,
    `Thoughts add fuel to the anxiety and the feeling perpetuates`,
    `The feeling would dissipate had thought not stepped in. When you feel like this, don’t try to do anything about it. Don’t “escape” from it. Watch the feeling. Really try to feel it. Go with it.`,
    `Realise it’s natural for different emotions to rise and fall throughout the day. Be aware of your surroundings, emotions and thoughts.`,
