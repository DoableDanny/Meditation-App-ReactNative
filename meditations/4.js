    `Living in the past causes depression. As you sit reading this, in this present moment, everything is fine.`,

    `Look around you. Is anything that terrible happening in front of you? The trouble is in your head. This might be difficult to hear for some people, but denying the truth will get you nowhere.`,
    `You sit in this present moment with images and movie clips of events that happened in the past playing in your mind. All of it an illusion. None of it real or true.  Just made up stuff in your head.`,

    `You may argue back and say that it is true because it actually did happen. But really, it’s just your perception of what happened, mutated each time it’s recalled by whatever emotions that you feel at the time. `,
    `So, you sit in the present moment with no problems. A thought then comes to mind and reminds you of a time you got drunk and embarrassed yourself in front of your family, or that you failed an exam and it reminds you that you’re a loser. You become sad, your energy drops and you want to escape from this pain somehow – TV, video games, alcohol.`,
    `Try sitting with these thoughts and emotions. Watch them. Watch the thoughts that are judging and condemning your thoughts without saying “no I shouldn’t think like that”. But even if you do think that, watch it. Let it happen.`,
    `You feel bored or anxious, don’t escape it, watch it, learn about it. See the truth of it. The truth being the actual thing as it is, just the feeling of anxiety, without trying to escape or correct it. You will find that it dissipates naturally.`,
