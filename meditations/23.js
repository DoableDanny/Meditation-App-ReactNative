    `The point of meditation is not to dull the mind, to numb it or distract it from itself. In fact, it’s the total opposite. It is a new awareness, a new kind of consciousness and energy. You begin to not identify with your mind and your actions are no longer controlled by thoughts.`,
    `It’s a new kind of action, one that is free from mental slavery. A total action. Completely free and filled with joy.`,
