    `Your mind, which is made up of your thoughts, beliefs, conclusions and ideals are all held in memory from past experiences, whether that be taught or through events, is not truth.`,

    `Imagine you were brought up in a different country with a different religion, language and traditions.`,
    `Your thoughts, beliefs and ideals would be much different to what you have. Thus you would behave differently. Perhaps you’d be happier or feel more confident. Maybe you’d be quicker to anger with those beliefs and ideals that tell you the way things ought to be and the way others should behave.`,
    `You have the power to change your perceptions. But nothing else.`,
