God look at the size of her, how can you live like that? Wish I had those trainers though!”`,
    `You’d be labelled mad. Yet everybody you walk by in that street has that constant voice in their head. Always running. Replaying clips of painful moments from the past causing a depression or thinking about events in the future that could go wrong, resulting in anxiety.`,
    `How is this acceptable? Surely this is no way to live.`,
    `Excessive thinking is a disease.`,
