    `An interesting idea to stop identifying with your thoughts: give your mind a name`,
    `This is very interesting because as you give your mind a name, suddenly it seems as if you are watching some other creature that is not you. This gives you the space to watch and not identify with your mind. Do you have disturbing thought X? "Well, Paul, you're being quite a busy bee aren't you?"`,
    `This is a good practice from ACT (Acceptance and commitment therapy). I recommend you try it.`,
    `We often suffer because we identify a lot with our mind and its disturbing thoughts. We think this is US and that they are true. As a result, we feel bad. But they just occur to us. By giving your mind a name it creates more space and you learn to take your thoughts with a large grain of salt. We are so accustomed to believing our every thought and belief. By giving our mind a name we can watch it more objectively as if we were in a laboratory.`,
    `Thoughts are nothing personal at all and frankly rarely true. They just happen. Building this awareness is liberating. The mind has its own agenda.  Get some popcorn and let the watching begin!`,
