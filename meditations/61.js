    `Lao Tzu frequently mentions to be like the “uncarved block”. It means to be simple and to work with your own nature. Not to have a noisy mind full of facts and desires. To not be tarnished by society. It is frivolous to fight one's own nature with cleverness.`,
    `Wu wei means to “do that which consists in taking no action and order will prevail.”. Stop trying to force action and get comfortable with doing less. Peace will come from subtracting from your life, not adding to it. Out of peace comes happiness, joy.`,
    `Then when you do move, your actions will be energetic, natural and purposeful. Observe the nature of the world: the skies are not always stormy, and the birds are not always in flight.`,
    `“From the sages emptiness, stillness arises, from stillness, action. From action, attainment.”`,
    `Wu wei means to not force it, be patient. You can make efforts but don’t work yourself into the ground. Not a lot may be happening in your life right now, but things will change suddenly. Be patient and don’t fight nature.`,
