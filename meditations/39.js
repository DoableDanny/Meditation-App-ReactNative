    `In watching the thought, you gain a deeper consciousness. You are not only aware of the thought, but also yourself witnessing the thought.`,
    `You see that your true self lies beneath the thought. You no longer identify with the thought – you’re not defined by it. It isn’t you. Therefore, the thought loses its power over you as it’s no longer fuelled by the mind identifying with it. The thought dissipates. The mind becomes still, at peace.`,
    `Joy of being comes out of this tranquillity. This is the essence of meditation.`,
