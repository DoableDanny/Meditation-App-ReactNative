    `Thought fuels emotion; emotion fuels thought.`,
    `A hostile, aggressive thought will create the feeling of anger. The thought is preparing the body to fight.`,
    `The root cause is fear – feeling threatened, physically or psychologically.`,
    `It may be difficult to not act out of overwhelming emotions, but if you are present enough in watching them, not identifying with them, they will not take root.`,
    `When you are angry, don’t focus on the object of your anger – the person that wronged you or the event that didn’t go your way. Feel, watch, explore the sensory reality of the anger itself.`,
    `Take a step back and watch carefully when strong emotions arise.`,
