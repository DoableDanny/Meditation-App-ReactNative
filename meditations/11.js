    `We all know the feeling of loneliness. It’s like a boredom, an urge to be entertained by somebody else by a book or movie or to always be working. An urge to be distracted from the self.`,

    `We are afraid to sit with just ourselves for company because deep down we are empty. No light is shining from within.`,
    `The next time this feeling arises, don’t escape from it. Look right at it, go with it. If you run away it will only be hiding around the corner to pounce on you again.`,
    `This is the beauty of meditation. You have to confront everything as it arises with no escape.`,
