    `The tale of two monks and a woman is on old Buddhist parable. It goes something like this:`,
    `Two monks were walking along the side of a river when they hear the cries of a woman. “My house is across this river, I crossed it to gather berries this morning. It rained heavily and I can’t swim, please can you help me cross!”`,
    `The larger monk said “sure, I’ll carry you across, we’re heading that way anyway.” He carried her over the river and the girl thanked them.`,
    `Later that evening, the shorter monk sighs “I can’t get this out of my mind, but you have sinned. As monks we took a vow to never touch a woman.”`,
    `The larger monk replies “you may be right, but I dropped her off 2 hours ago. You are still carrying her aren’t you?”`,
  ],
};
