      '"The mind is a superb instrument if used rightly. Used wrongly, however, it becomes very destructive. To put it more accurately, it is not so much that you use your mind wrongly – you usually don’t use it at all. It uses you. This is the disease. You believe that you are your mind. This is the delusion. The instrument has taken over you."',

  paragraphs: [
    `A noisy mind means you are identified with it. You are a slave to your mind. It is like you are possessed without even knowing it, and you take this possessing entity to be yourself.`,
    `Freedom begins when you realise that you are not this possessing entity, and you start to watch it. It is then you can see that there is a whole new area of consciousness above that of thought. There is a vast field of intelligence beyond thoughts and concepts.`,
    `All things that truly matter – love, joy, peace – arise from beyond the mind.`,
