    `If you don’t take responsibility for your happiness, then you’ll never be happy. There will always be someone else to blame – society or your parents, and you’ll never do anything about it because you believe it’s out of your hands.`,
    `The first step to becoming happy is believing that it’s possible. Choose to become happy.`,
