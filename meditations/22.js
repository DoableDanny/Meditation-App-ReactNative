    `Can you just watch the thinker? Watch without judgement or condemnation the thoughts that the mind feeds you. Can you watch the thought that says “I am meditating, therefore I should not be thinking, but I am thinking…” without trying to stop it or think about something else? Go with it. Go into it. Understand it.`,
    `Be aware of all of your surroundings: the sounds, smells, colour of the sky, as well as the excitement or anxiety running through your body.`,
