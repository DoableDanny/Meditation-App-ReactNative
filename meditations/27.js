    `During these meditations, you may have thought that having something to read, or something to think about is counterintuitive or contradictory to what meditation is supposed to be.`,
    `But remember, meditation isnâ€™t about controlling your mind, or forcing it to think about anything, but just allowing to do what it does. Offering no resistance, thoughts and feelings can flow, come and go as they please.`,
    `Perhaps some of these meditations have challenged you or have been contradictory to your current beliefs. Making your mind a little noisy. I think this is good, and makes the meditation more beneficial.`,
    `It gives you the opportunity to face these thoughts head on without evading them, allowing you to resolve them.`,
