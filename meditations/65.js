    `Man is spurred on by desire and greed to be always wanting greater gratification. Lau Tzu believed it is necessary to keep a very close watch on these desires. To counter these natural tendencies with the lessons of “knowing contentment” and “knowing when to stop”.`,
    `To understand these lessons means to live contentfully, knowing you have everything you need in this present moment.`,
    `“He who knows contentment is rich.”`,
    `Desire can be good. Without desire you would have no wants to gain a better understanding of the world or yourself. But desire narrows focus. If you are always desiring more, then you are not content. You won’t be able to look around, be present, and appreciate what you have. You can only see the mysteries of the world by not desiring.`,
    `You must live the paradox of trying and not trying; learning and letting go of learning. Knowing when to stop and be content.`,
    `“There is no crime greater than having too many desires;
    There is no disaster greater than not being content;
    There is no misfortune greater than being covetous.”
    `,
    `We dislike uncertainty as it implies our lives could be at risk. But to embrace uncertainty is to live joyfully and at peace with what is.`,
    `“Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you.” `,
