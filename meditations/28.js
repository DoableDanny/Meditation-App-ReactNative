    `Your negative emotions do not have to persist. This does not mean that they will disappear but rather that you have it within your control to not linger on them.`,
    `Imagine for a moment that you are stuck in a particular emotion. Maybe someone has made you angry and you find it difficult to shake the feeling. You do this by ruminating on the reason why you are justified to feel the way you do. You have perfectly valid reasons for being angry, after all. Your mental state is completely occupied by the sense of anger when your phone rings. This forces you to immediately put on your best social face. You've switched to a new state of mind. Most of the time, we'll immediately switch back to our prior state of negative emotion once the call is hung up.`,
    `A positive change can start by becoming aware of the sudden changes in our mental states that may occur throughout the day. You are depressed but moved to laughter by something you read. You are bored and impatient in traffic but then cheered by a call from a close friend.`,
    `Simply noticing that paying attention to something else changes your state of mind can offer a true glimpse of freedom. You will start realizing how temporary your emotions are, how very fragile their state of existence really is. Your emotions are really nothing but a constant rolling of one emotional wave after another. There is freedom in realizing that it is futile to attempt to hold on to any of them.`,
    `The practice of noticing can start by paying close attention to the negative feelings themselves, without judgement or resistance. What is anger? Where do you feel it in your body? How is it arising in each moment? And what is it that is aware of the feeling itself? Peering inward with mindfulness can lead to your discovery that negative states of mind vanish all by themselves.`,
