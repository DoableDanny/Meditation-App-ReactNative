    `We have become slaves to our minds. Everything that the mind says, we take to heart, we identify with it.`,
    `You’re sitting in your garden relaxing on a Saturday after a week’s work. Your friend Joe is on holiday in Italy. A thought enters saying “I’d love to take the wife to Italy, we never do anything like that. I should get a better job so I can afford these things, but I’m not as smart as Joe.”`,
    `From these thoughts, these random thoughts that just popped into your head, you conclude that you are poor, unadventurous, and unintelligent. All just words. What we truly are lies beyond words.`,
    `It is your minds job to feed you with thoughts. Can you watch the thinker - the thing feeding you these thoughts – without becoming them? Can you see the stupidity of identifying yourself with everything that pops into your head?`,
    `If you can – see the absolute truth of it - then you will no longer identify with your thoughts.`,
