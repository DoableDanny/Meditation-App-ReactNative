      '"Without wisdom the mind is sick, and the body itself, however physically powerful, can only have the kind of strength that is found in persons in a demented or delirious state. So this is the sort of healthiness you must make your principal concern. You must attend to the other as well, but see that it takes second place."',

    `The stoics strongly believed that the mind should be taken care of over everything else, and that this could be done through gaining wisdom and holding close to philosophy each day.`,
    `“The life of folly is empty of gratitude, and full of anxiety” – Epicurus (Whilst Epicurus belonged to a different school of thought, Seneca believed that what was well said also belonged to him. He wasn’t interested in making petty enemies.)`,
    `Be gracious and content with what you have. This will rid you of much anxiety and prevent your mind from wandering off into the future, seeking for “greater” things.`,
    `Seneca says to “continually remind yourself of the many things you have achieved. When you look at all the people in front of you, think of all the ones behind you.”`,
