    `Nerves, or anxiety, are caused by living too much in the future. The future being uncertain. Our beliefs are static things, conclusions stored in memory that cause us so much grief when reality doesn’t conform to them.`,
    `You have a presentation to give Monday morning for work. You’re well prepared and know the material very well. You know that you will deliver a good presentation. Yet you’re still nervous.`,
    `You care about what your boss thinks. All your time was dedicated to the presentation itself and zero in attending to your nervousness. Perhaps you worked so hard on the presentation to distract yourself from your nerves. Perhaps you’ll have a drink or watch TV to escape, take your mind off it. But it won’t be resolved and it will slither its way back.`,
    `Other’s opinions are not under your control and therefore require none of your attention. What requires attention is your dependence for approval. Look deeply into your reactions and emotions. See the reality that the opinions of others are not the problem. The problem lies solely within you. Watch your reactions and emotions, the thoughts that cause them. Understand and see the truth of it.`,
    `Take the time to understand this because when you do, you will no longer depend on others.`,
