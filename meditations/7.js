      '"Meditation is intermittent fasting for the mind. Too much sugar leads to a heavy body, and too many distractions lead to a heavy mind. Time spent undistracted and alone, in self-examination, journaling, meditation, resolves the unresolved and takes us from mentally fat to fit."',

    `2.5 thousand years ago, Buddha told us that every comparison brings us suffering. Whenever we compare ourselves to others, we are collecting suffering. Everybody has their own innate unique personality that should be allowed to flourish without external or internal resistance.`,
    `Today we sit on our mobile phones, flicking through 100s of Facebook statements and pictures that others have carefully constructed. People smiling with their many friends on great vacations with their amazing other halves. You finish up depressed because you feel you aren’t as happy or as successful as these people.`,
    `We’re also bombarded with headlines and advertisements every day, disaster news stories and people outraged on twitter. It distorts our view of the world into something totally inaccurate. All of this isn’t real life. It is designed to stir your emotions to keep you watching.`,
    `How do you deal with all this nonsense? See it for what it truly is. Made up ideas and carefully constructed images. Has the girl with the beaming smile partying in the Facebook picture got a better life than you, or has she got to be up at 7 am for an 8 hour shift with a hangover?`,
    `There is no need to wish ill on these people or judge them, let them live as they wish. Why should people live the way you think they should? Focus on living your own life.`,
    `When you see the reality of social media and news, and that it’s detrimental to your health, perhaps you will no longer want to use it. It won’t take any effort to quit either. Once you see the truth of something, the action becomes effortless. You will just do it.`,
