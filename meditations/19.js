    `I am not a fan of the word “enlightenment”. It suggests some super-human accomplishment - you’ve transcended and found some superior way of living. It isn’t healthy to see yourself as separate from society, as better than it.`,
    `You can think and behave differently to society, but you still have to be a part of it. The goal is not to alienate yourself. Living peacefully isn’t some renunciation from society and material things. That isn’t living at all. Seeing yourself as not part of society will only create fear and anxiety.`,
    `All enlightenment really means is that you have a quiet and peaceful mind. That you have found your true nature beyond name and form.`,
    `This is a beautiful thing. It means the end of suffering. It means dying to the past every moment in time, to be completely present.`,
