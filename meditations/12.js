    `The more you judge - people’s appearance, their actions, material things – the more you separate yourself from everyone else. “God he’s so overweight, how can you live like that”. Thoughts like this make you feel good for a second – you’ll feel better than them, but then you’ll feel lonely. Then you’ll see negativity everywhere.`,
    `The world just reflects your own feelings back at you. Reality is neutral, it has no judgements. It’s all how you choose to interpret it.`,
    `If you believe happiness is a choice, then you can start working on it. This is absolutely possible.`,
