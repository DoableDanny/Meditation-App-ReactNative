      '"If you seek tranquillity, do less.’ Or (more accurately) do what’s essential—what the logos of a social being requires, and in the requisite way. Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better. Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, ‘Is this necessary?"',
    author: 'Marcus Aurelius',

    `An important area of stoic thought is to follow the “logos”. The logos is a term used by stoics that means human nature and the way things work in the universe. The Stoics believe that you cannot control the world around you, only how you respond.`,
    `They believe that nature gives people rules and guidelines to live in accordance with. This is done by living virtuously.`,
    `The four stoic virtues:`,
    `•	Wisdom: to know what is under your control and what isn’t.`,
    `•	Temperance: to understand moderation. Knowing what you need and what is excess.`,
    `•	Justice: your actions contribute to the common good.`,
    `•	Courage: to be good and incorruptible under any circumstance.`,
