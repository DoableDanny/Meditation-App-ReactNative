      '"Realize deeply that the present moment is all you have. Make the NOW the primary focus of your life."',
    author: 'Eckhart Tolle',
  },
  paragraphs: [
    `The past and present are illusions. All you have is the present moment, which is changing constantly every second. From present moment to present moment. Nothing is stationary or certain.`,

    `Embrace this uncertainty because this is called living. Life would be boring if we knew exactly how everything is going to pan out.`,
    `What does it mean to live in the present moment? It means to be content with what is. To not dwell on the past or to seek for a better future.`,
    `I think that this way of life comes about through self-understanding, total truth and honesty with yourself. By seeing things for what they truly are, not through a cloud of thoughts, ideals and beliefs which are just made up things.`,
    `Everybody has their own little beliefs and ideals, it is the source of all conflict. “He shouldn’t have said that, it’s totally unacceptable.”`,

    `But the person who said it will have their own beliefs made up from their own past experiences. So thoughts are not truth. They are made up by people and are subjective.`,
    `Truth can only be experienced in the absence of thought. It is a great feeling, peace. When you can just see things for what they are, it is to be meditative.`,

    `To just look at a pretty face or flower and enjoy it, without thinking of all the science and history behind it all.`,
