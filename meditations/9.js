    `The avoidance of pain will only lead to greater pain down the road. Therefore you must deal with emotions and thoughts as soon as they arise. To do this you have to be highly aware, meditative at all times.`,
    `It is not possible to do this with a tired or dull mind. A mind that is drugged with alcohol or weighed down by an overweight body. You’ve heard the saying before “a healthy body is a healthy mind”. It is all connected. You can only have an attentive, sharp mind if you take care of both.`,
    `How do you become highly aware and meditative? You have to take the time to sit with your own thoughts and emotions. To watch them and understand them. To not get caught up with any particular beliefs.`,
    `But meditation isn’t withdrawal from life. Real life is all about your relationship with people and material goods. Watch your reactions carefully when you’re talking to someone. Are you even listening to the other person or are you thinking about what you’re going to say next?`,
    `Meditation is total awareness.`,
