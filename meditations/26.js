    `Jordan Peterson says to “ask yourself what remarkably stupid things am I doing to screw up my life. But don’t just ask it. You have to really want to know the answer.”`,
    `“Three years from now you could have what you want. But you have to be careful about what it is, and you’ve gotta aim at it.”`,
    `It’s important to have a goal. You can point out to something far out in the distance. It can’t just be anything, or lots of things; you can’t have everything. It has to be something that you truly want with all your heart. And it has to be defined specifically. You don’t just stumble on what you want if you don’t even know what you want.`,
    `If you have to ask yourself whether you want it or not, then the answer is no. There’s no need to ask that question when you find your true purpose in life, what you were born to do.`,
    ` To have something to work on every day that gives your life tremendous meaning. To have just one thing to suffer over means that when a huge wave hits, and things come crashing down, you can get back up. Because you know what it’s all for.`,
